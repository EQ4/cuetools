cuebreakpoints was not printing the last track breakpoint.  This has been
fixed.

cueprint now prints a zero-length string for undefined values.  Flags, width,
and precision are applied to conversion characters which have no conversion.

Added a tagging script, cuetag.sh, which uses cueprint, vorbiscomment, and
mp3info to tag Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files.  This needs more testing and
documentation.

Added a track selection flag to cueprint.

1.1

File formats documentation has been readded and updated (docs/formats.txt).

CDTEXTFILE is now a recognized (but ignored) keyword.

If only a disc or track template is specified on the command line, then only
the disc or track information is printed, respectively.

cueprint now supports flags and width and precision values for template
expansion (like the printf command).

1.0

cuetools-1.x is a significant code rewrite of 0.x.  The cue/toc parsing code
has been reimplemented in lex/yacc.

cuerename has been replaced by the more general utility cueprint.

Usage syntax of the utilities has changed.  See the respective man pages.
